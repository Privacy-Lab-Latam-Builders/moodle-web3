# Moodle Web3

**Moodle Web3** is a "key on hand" learning management system (LMS) that seamlessly integrates Moodle, one of the most widely used LMS platforms, with cutting-edge web3 tools. This includes an Ethereum wallet where users can receive certifications as NFTs, POAPs (Proof of Attendance Protocol tokens), and other digital assets. Utilizing Push Protocol notifications, Moodle Web3 offers an intuitive introduction to the web3 ecosystem, empowering educators and learners to interact with decentralized applications, manage digital assets securely, and stay informed with real-time updates. This platform bridges traditional education with web3 technology, enriching the learning experience and preparing users for the decentralized web.
